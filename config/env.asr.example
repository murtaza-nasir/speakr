# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Speakr Configuration: ASR Endpoint (Legacy)
#
# ⚠️  DEPRECATION NOTICE: This configuration style is still supported but
# we recommend using the new unified configuration in env.transcription.example
# which supports all transcription providers with auto-detection.
#
# Migration: Simply set ASR_BASE_URL and the connector will auto-detect ASR mode.
# USE_ASR_ENDPOINT=true is no longer required (but still works for backwards compat).
#
# Instructions:
# 1. Copy this file to a new file named .env
#    cp env.asr.example .env
# 2. Fill in the required URLs, API keys, and settings below.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# --- Text Generation Model (for summaries, titles, etc.) ---
TEXT_MODEL_BASE_URL=https://openrouter.ai/api/v1
TEXT_MODEL_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key
TEXT_MODEL_NAME=openai/gpt-4o-mini

# --- GPT-5 Specific Settings (only used with OpenAI API and GPT-5 models) ---
# If using GPT-5 models (gpt-5, gpt-5-mini, gpt-5-nano, gpt-5-chat-latest) with OpenAI API,
# these parameters will be used instead of temperature.
#
# Example GPT-5 configuration:
# TEXT_MODEL_BASE_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1
# TEXT_MODEL_NAME=gpt-5-mini
#
# Reasoning effort: minimal, low, medium, high (default: medium)
# - minimal: Fastest responses, minimal reasoning tokens
# - low: Fast responses with basic reasoning
# - medium: Balanced reasoning and speed (recommended)
# - high: Maximum reasoning for complex tasks
GPT5_REASONING_EFFORT=medium
#
# Verbosity: low, medium, high (default: medium)
# - low: Concise responses
# - medium: Balanced detail
# - high: Detailed explanations
GPT5_VERBOSITY=medium

# --- Chat Model Configuration (Optional) ---
# Configure a separate model for real-time chat interactions.
# If not set, chat will use the TEXT_MODEL_* settings above.
#
# Use cases:
# - Use a faster model for chat while using a more capable model for summarization
# - Use a cheaper model for interactive chat to reduce costs
# - Use different service tiers for different operations
#
# CHAT_MODEL_API_KEY=your_chat_api_key
# CHAT_MODEL_BASE_URL=https://openrouter.ai/api/v1
# CHAT_MODEL_NAME=openai/gpt-4o

# --- Chat GPT-5 Settings (only used with OpenAI API and GPT-5 chat models) ---
# These settings allow independent control of GPT-5 parameters for chat.
# If not set, falls back to the main GPT5_* settings above.
#
# CHAT_GPT5_REASONING_EFFORT=medium
# CHAT_GPT5_VERBOSITY=medium

# --- Transcription Service (ASR Endpoint) ---
# New connector architecture auto-detects ASR mode when ASR_BASE_URL is set.
# USE_ASR_ENDPOINT=true is deprecated but still works for backwards compatibility.
#
# Note: ASR endpoints handle chunking internally - CHUNK_LIMIT settings are ignored.

# ASR Endpoint URL (setting this auto-enables ASR mode)
# For containers in same docker-compose: Use container name and internal port
# Example: http://whisper-asr:9000 (NOT the host port 6002 or external IP)
# For external ASR: Use http://192.168.1.100:9000 or http://asr.example.com:9000
ASR_BASE_URL=http://whisper-asr:9000

# Deprecated: No longer needed, kept for backwards compatibility
# USE_ASR_ENDPOINT=true

# Speaker diarization options
ASR_DIARIZE=true
# ASR_MIN_SPEAKERS=1         # Hint for minimum speakers
# ASR_MAX_SPEAKERS=5         # Hint for maximum speakers
# ASR_RETURN_SPEAKER_EMBEDDINGS=false  # Only enable for WhisperX ASR service

# --- Application Settings ---
# Set to "true" to allow user registration, "false" to disable

REGISTRATION_ALLOWED_DOMAINS=
SUMMARY_MAX_TOKENS=8000

TIMEZONE="UTC"

# Set the logging level for the application.
# Options: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR
LOG_LEVEL="INFO"

# --- Audio Compression ---
# Automatically compress lossless uploads (WAV, AIFF) to save storage
AUDIO_COMPRESS_UPLOADS=true

# Target codec: mp3 (lossy, smallest), flac (lossless), opus (lossy, efficient)
AUDIO_CODEC=mp3

# Bitrate for lossy codecs (ignored for FLAC)
AUDIO_BITRATE=128k

# Unsupported codecs - comma-separated list of codecs to exclude from supported list
# Use this if your transcription service doesn't support certain codecs
# Supported codecs by default: pcm_s16le, pcm_s24le, pcm_f32le, mp3, flac, opus, vorbis, aac
# Example: AUDIO_UNSUPPORTED_CODECS=opus,vorbis
# AUDIO_UNSUPPORTED_CODECS=

# --- Admin User (created on first run) ---
ADMIN_USERNAME=admin

# --- Automated File Processing (Black Hole Directory) ---
# Set to "true" to enable automated file processing
ENABLE_AUTO_PROCESSING=false

# --- Automated Export Settings ---
# Automatically export transcriptions and summaries to markdown files

# AUTO_PROCESS_DEFAULT_USERNAME=admin

# --- Auto-Deletion & Retention Settings ---
# Enable automated deletion of old recordings
ENABLE_AUTO_DELETION=false

# Number of days to retain recordings (0 = disabled)
# Example: 90 means recordings older than 90 days will be processed
GLOBAL_RETENTION_DAYS=90

# Deletion mode: 'audio_only' keeps transcription, 'full_recording' deletes everything
# audio_only: Deletes audio file but keeps transcription/summary/notes (recommended)
# full_recording: Permanently deletes the entire recording from database
DELETION_MODE=audio_only

# --- Permission-Based Deletion Controls ---
# Allow all users to delete their recordings, or restrict to admins only
# true: All users can delete their own recordings (default)

# --- Incognito Mode (HIPAA-friendly) ---
# Enable incognito mode for privacy-sensitive transcriptions
# When enabled, users can upload recordings that are:
# - Processed on the server but NOT saved to the database
# - Stored only in the browser's sessionStorage (lost when tab closes)

# Useful for HIPAA compliance or sensitive recordings
# Default: false (feature hidden)
ENABLE_INCOGNITO_MODE=false

# --- Background Processing Queues ---
# Separate queues for transcription (slow) and summary (fast) jobs
# This prevents slow ASR jobs from blocking quick summary generation

JOB_QUEUE_WORKERS=2

# Summary queue workers (for LLM summarization, default: 2)
SUMMARY_QUEUE_WORKERS=2

# Maximum retry attempts for failed jobs (default: 3)
