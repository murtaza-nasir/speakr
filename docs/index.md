## Interactive Audio Synchronization

Experience seamless bidirectional synchronization between your audio and transcript. Click any part of the transcript to jump directly to that moment in the audio, or watch as the system automatically highlights the currently spoken text as the audio plays. Enable auto-scroll follow mode to keep the active segment centered in view, creating an effortless reading experience for even the longest recordings.

!!! tip "Transform Your Recordings with Custom Tag Prompts"
    Tags aren't just for organization - they transform content. Create a "Recipe" tag to convert cooking narration into formatted recipes. Use "Study Notes" tags to turn lecture recordings into organized outlines. Stack tags like "Client Meeting" + "Legal Review" for combined analysis. Learn more in the [Custom Prompts guide](admin-guide/prompts.md#creative-tag-prompt-use-cases).

## Latest Updates

!!! info "Version 0.10.20-alpha - Interface themes, Ambrose, nested folders"
    Eight columns are added at startup, and recordings left without an owner by earlier versions are removed by a daily step. New accounts start with the Cards theme; read the Upgrading section of the release notes for the defaults and how to keep the previous ones.

    - **Interface** - Six themes with every color scheme and dark mode, and a What's new list after each update.
    - **Ambrose** - One assistant for the recording chat and Inquire, with cited answers and a chat per recording.
    - **Folders and prompts** - Nested folders (PR #585) and the Regenerate summary dialog (#584).
    - **Administration and sharing** - `.env` settings in System Settings (#567), group shares that follow the group (#570, #582), and fixes for #571, #572, #578, #579, #581 and #583.

!!! info "Version 0.10.19-alpha - Transcript translation, faster uploads, fair queues"
    Five columns and a unique index on active processing jobs are added at startup. Uploads are converted by convert jobs (`CONVERT_QUEUE_WORKERS`, default 2); read the release notes before going back to an earlier version.

    - **Translation** - Transcripts can be translated on demand or automatically, with an optional separate translation model (PR #538).
    - **Processing** - Uploads are answered before conversion, every user gets a turn in the queues, and Inquire indexing has its own worker (discussions #541 to #543).
    - **Watch folder** - Watched files go through the upload pipeline without its size limits, and a file that cannot be processed is renamed to `<name>.failed` (PR #552).
    - **Fixes** - Recordings made on iPhones (#495), `.local` email addresses (#551), seeking in long videos (#539), and #530 to #534.

!!! info "Version 0.10.18-alpha - Login lock, incognito fixes, scoped API tools"
    A `login_failure` table and two login settings are added at startup.

    - **Security** - Password sign-in is locked per account and client address after repeated wrong passwords, with an unlock in User Management (discussion #529).
    - **Incognito** - Chat works again (#527), and the recording is kept through a page reload (#528).
    - **API** - The OpenAPI document lists only the operations a scoped token may call (#526).

!!! note "Earlier releases"
    Release notes for v0.10.17 and earlier are on the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/murtaza-nasir/speakr/releases).
